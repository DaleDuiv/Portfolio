# Portfolio
Description
We were given a task to create a Portfolio.
This is my first time designing a website, and thus has been challenging.
This Portfolio had a strong element of Flexbox's and a need to know them. Even once submitting I will still be working on this project, maybe creating a new one entirely, as I am interested in having a portfolio page, however I need to start fresh, and have simply ran out of time, with this being my 2nd or 3rd attempt at making a portfolio. I still have a lot to learn about flexbox, and media query.
This homework challenge has taught me how to use Mediaquery, however I am experiencing some troubles with some properties.
My biggest hurdle would be fixing one issue, which would then cause another. I need to simplify things in the future and try and find a holistic solution.
