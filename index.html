      <h3>About me</h3>
      <div class= "container my-details">
      <p>I'm Dale, I'm new to coding, trying to learn this as I continue to work Full-time at a financial instituion as a Relationship Consultant. 
        I live South of Adelaide, South Australia. Previously studied at Flinders University, however moved into full-time work and didn't complete University. Prior study was Reynella East College.
      <br>
      A goal of mine is to develop my coding skill to get me into some new opportunities in the world, while at the same time learning a tangible skill I can take home with me.
      <br>
      My personal acheivements in my eyes are my two children, I put them first in everything I do, and they are my motivation to keep improving.
      <br>
      Favourite hobbies of mine include: Watching Sport (AFL mostly), I'm an Adelaide Crows member. I enjoy spending time with my kids, when I have time, I like to jump onto my quest VR to play some games that keep me moving.
      Watching Youtube is also a pass-time I enjoy. 
      <br>
      My current skills Include a basic knowledge of HTML and CSS. I have developed skills specific to a financial institution in the Service/Sales section of retail banking. I am looking for a change of direction.
